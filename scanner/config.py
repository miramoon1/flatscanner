    # Deliberately NOT including a bare "jumeirah" entry: Dubai has several
    # "Jumeirah *"-branded areas that aren't actually the water-adjacent Jumeirah
    # district — Jumeirah Village Circle/Triangle, Jumeirah Lake Towers, Jumeirah Park,
    # Jumeirah Heights — and a plain substring match on "jumeirah" was silently
    # matching all of them too (confirmed live: "Jumeirah Village Circle, Dubai" was
    # getting flagged "Preferred area"). The specific entries below (Jumeirah 1/2/3,
    # JBR, Palm Jumeirah, Jumeirah Golf Estates, etc.) already cover every genuine
    # Jumeirah-area listing seen in real data without that false-positive risk.
